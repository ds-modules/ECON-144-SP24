    "We can evaulate risk forecsts for **accuracy** via a liner regression method suggested by Mincer and Zarnowitz (1969, \"The Evaluation of Economic Forecasts\"). It is posited that realized portfolio return variance can be desricbed by the following model: $$ \\tilde{\\sigma}_t^2 = a + b \\hat{\\sigma}_t^2 + \\epsilon_t $$ where $\\hat{\\sigma}_t^2$ (right-hand side) is forecast return variance and $\\tilde{\\sigma}_t^2$ (left-hand side) is realized return variance. However, realized return varaince is not observable **ex post**. Therefore, realized return variance is **proxied** by the squared (demeaned) realized return at time $t$. This is an unbiased, but noisy, proxy for the \"true\" variance at time $t$. Assuming this model of realized return variance is correct, the joint null hypothesis (that our forecast is accurate) is $H_0: a= 0, b=1$.\n",
